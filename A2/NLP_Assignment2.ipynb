    "This Notebook encompasses all aspects of the assignment, namely the descriptions of tasks as well as your solutions and reports. Feel free to add any required cell for solutions. The cells can contain code, reports, charts, tables, or any other material, required for the assignment. Feel free to provide the solutions in an interactive and visual way!\n",

Project these feature vectors to a 2-dimensional space using the TSNE method.  Using these 2-dimensional vectors, create two plots where the dataitems are shown as points (small circles) on the plots. The plots look exactly the same but only differ in the coloring of the data points. The first plot colors every dataitem with its *true label*, while the second one colors each according to its *predicted label by the model*. Keep in mind to assign the same colors to the classes of the plots, so that the plots are visually comparable. Put these two plots side by side, observe the differences, and compare the results. Report your observations.\n",
